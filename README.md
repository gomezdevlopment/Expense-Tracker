# Track My Expenses - Expense Tracker App
An android app that allows you to easily manage your expenses and income quickly.

## Description
This app is built to allow the user to quickly and easily create entries for their expenses and
income and give them an overview of their current balance. \
\
This app uses the MPAndroid library from Philipp Jahoda to display charts of the users income
and expenses.\
\
I used Room Database to store the users entries on device. The user also has the option to export their data in the form of a csv file using the SHARE Intent. 


### Other Features
- Users can select previous months on the main screen to see their expense history.
- Users can select a profile photo from their device.
- Users can change the currency displayed. (Options include US Dollar, Euro, British Pound, and   Japanese Yen)
- Users can select a light or dark theme, or choose their system default.
